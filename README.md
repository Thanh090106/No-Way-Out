#No-Way-Out
This is my second personal project for a GameJam. All of the code (C#) for the game is Assets --> Scripts. 
Me and my partner are currently making a highly developed horror game that has multiple endings and a story that leads the user to play more.

The Game: You are a insane person that was just admitted to a mental hospital. Your goal is to Survive through the dungeon/hospital by running away from the enemy and escaping or by killing the enemy then escaping, the choice is yours. There are 2 endings to this game so be careful what you choose.
