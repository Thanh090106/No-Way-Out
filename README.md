#No-Way-Out
This is my second personal project for a GameJam. All of the code (C#) for the game is Assets --> Scripts. 
Me and my partner are currently making a highly developed horror game that has multiple endings and a story that leads the user to play more.
You are in a dungeon and your main objective is to escape with what you have in your surroundings.
